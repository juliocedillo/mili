    <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666;">Julio grew up in San Diego, California with an overwhelming military presence. As a Chicano Studies major, he noticed that San Diego did not have an active political scene compared to Los Angeles, primarily due to the military bases engulfing Barrio Logan. As a majority of his cousins enlisted, he came to realize that the military becomes an instrument of social mobility as with Chicanos in WWII.</p>
